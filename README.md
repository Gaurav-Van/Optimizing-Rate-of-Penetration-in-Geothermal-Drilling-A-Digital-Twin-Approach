# Optimizing-Rate-of-Penetration-in-Geothermal-Drilling-A-Digital-Twin-Approach
Letâ€™s explore something interesting together. In this project, we developed a machine learning digital twin using Intel-optimized XGBoost and daal4py to simulate and optimize the Rate of Penetration (ROP) in geothermal drilling. We leveraged SHAP for Explainable AI (XAI) to interpret model predictions.
